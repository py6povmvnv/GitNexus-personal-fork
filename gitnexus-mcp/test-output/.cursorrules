# GitNexus Code Intelligence

This project uses GitNexus MCP for code understanding. When working with this codebase, you have access to powerful code intelligence tools.

## Available MCP Tools

### search
Semantic search across code. Returns functions, classes, files matching meaning.
- Use for: Finding code by description, not exact text
- Example queries: "authentication logic", "database connection handling", "error middleware"

### cypher
Direct KuzuDB graph queries for precise relationship traversal.
- Use for: Finding call chains, imports, inheritance
- Pattern: `MATCH (f:Function)-[:CodeRelation {type:'CALLS'}]->(g:Function) RETURN f.name, g.name`
- Node types: File, Folder, Function, Class, Interface, Method, CodeElement
- Relation types: CONTAINS, DEFINES, IMPORTS, CALLS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS

### blastRadius
Find all code affected by changing a node. Returns N-hop connections.
- Use for: Before refactoring, understanding impact of changes
- Returns: List of connected nodes with their types

### highlight
Highlight nodes in the graph visualization.
- Use for: Showing the user what you're looking at

### context
Get project overview: stats, hotspots, folder tree.
- Use for: Understanding project structure, finding important files
- Returns: File counts, hotspots (most connected files), directory tree

### grep
Regex pattern search across file contents.
- Use for: Finding exact patterns, TODOs, specific strings
- Faster than search for literal text

### read
Read file content by path. Supports line ranges.
- Use for: Reading actual code after finding via search/grep

## Best Practices

1. **Start with context** - Run `context` first to understand project structure
2. **Use search for discovery** - Find relevant code by meaning, not keywords
3. **Use cypher for relationships** - When you need call chains, imports, inheritance
4. **Check blast radius before refactoring** - Understand impact before making changes
5. **Read to confirm** - After finding code via search, read it to see full context

## Cypher Query Examples

```cypher
# Find all functions that call a specific function
MATCH (caller:Function)-[:CodeRelation {type:'CALLS'}]->(target:Function {name: 'authenticate'})
RETURN caller.name, caller.filePath

# Find class inheritance chain
MATCH (child:Class)-[:CodeRelation {type:'EXTENDS'}]->(parent:Class)
RETURN child.name, parent.name

# Find all imports in a file
MATCH (f:File {name: 'api.ts'})-[:CodeRelation {type:'IMPORTS'}]->(imported:File)
RETURN imported.name, imported.filePath

# Find hotspots (most connected nodes)
MATCH (n)-[r:CodeRelation]-()
RETURN n.name, labels(n), count(r) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC LIMIT 10
```
